# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., TypeScript 5.x, Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., React Native (Expo SDK), FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., react-native-mmkv, PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., Jest + React Native Testing Library, Maestro, pytest, XCTest or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., iOS 15+ / Android 11+, Linux server, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 60fps animations, 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., Native-first UX, <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

**Required Verifications**:

- [ ] Native-First Performance: Feature maintains 60fps animations and instant interactions
- [ ] Universal by Default: Cross-platform code used unless platform divergence justified
- [ ] Type Safety: Strict TypeScript enabled, no `any` types without justification
- [ ] Zero Legacy: Uses New Architecture (Fabric/TurboModules), no legacy bridge dependencies
- [ ] Technology Stack Compliance: Uses approved libraries (NativeWind, TanStack Query, Zustand, FlashList, etc.)
- [ ] Development Guidelines: Absolute imports, functional components, proper styling approach
- [ ] Operational Constraints: Safe Areas, Accessibility (44px min height, labels), Error boundaries

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
